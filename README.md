# hello-world
Github get-started: first repository 

## Welcome to my first ever repository
---
That's supposed to be my *introduction*, but I don't really like to talk about myself,
so the first thing you alredy know about me, is that I'm a **modest** person.
Although you might be calling that into question because, let's be honest
> who **boldly** declares their modesty? :wink:.

If you at least smirked after reading that, that means *undeniably*, that I'm **amusing**.
My introduction is also happend to be my excersice of using *Markdown* text, so let me
create a list of my *attributes* (:wink:) :
- modest
- amusing

and I think I should mentioned at least three of them, so let me add more:
  1. modest
  2. amusing
  3. diligent
  4. detail-oriented
  5. dedicated

In all seriousness, I always try my best to make the outcome satisfying,
not only for me, but for everyone who will be working with me.
I care about the details and try to make my knowledge usefull,
and to highlight my point ==I am diligent and committed to delivering results== .

**Thank you very much for your attention :star: I hope I didn't put you to sleep**
